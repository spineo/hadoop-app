# hadoop-app

In this example I will be setting up an Apache Hadoop Multi-node Cluster on AWS and processing a set of input text files using the Hadoop Streaming API and Python Mapper/Reducers. The simple application will perform the same task we saw in our Spark App (https://github.com/spineo/spark-app) but instead use the Hadoop framework to output the alphabet letter counts.
